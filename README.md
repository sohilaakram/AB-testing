# AB-testing
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these

For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# Conclousions
In this Project, we applied statistics and logistic regression to understand A/B test results of e-commerce store website to decide if the new page should be launched or not. it turn out that the old page is better. We analyzed the result using exact propotions, A/B testing and sampling distribution and logistic regression model and all of them lead to the same result of keeping the old page. Maybe if we run the expirement for more time, more users will convert and our conclousion would be different but knowing that the probability an individual received the new page is 0.5 indicaties that there is equality in both groups.
